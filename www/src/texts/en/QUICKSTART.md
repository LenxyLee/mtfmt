This section shows how to add the `MtFmt` library to your project. In the latest version, we provide a CMake file in the repository. You can add the source files by hand or by git submodule.

# Download

A simple way to download source files is that [click here](https://github.com/MtFmT-Lib/mtfmt/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). It will download the zip file from the main branch of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MtFmT-Lib/mtfmt). The other way is to install git and run the following command in your terminal, which is suitable for the professional developer.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:MtFmT-Lib/mtfmt.git
# or: https://github.com/MtFmT-Lib/mtfmt.git if you have not ssh key
```

You can add it to the git submodule also.

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:MtFmT-Lib/mtfmt.git
```

# Add into project

The two folders should be included in the archive file. The `src` folder including C source files is all implementations. And, the `inc` folder includes C header files and C++ wrapper header files. A reasonable approach is to create a new folder to contain the `inc` and the `src` directories and copy that into your project directory.

## The Keil IDE

Using the middleware package is an easy way to add to the Keil IDE. You can find them here. As an alternative option, you can add the sources and configure the including path manually.

### Using the package

The middleware package was auto-generated by GitHub action.

### Add sources by Manual

Firstly, select the "Add existing file to Source Group" option like the figure 1.

Then, add all files in the folder `src` into your project.

Now you add all source files succeeded. The next step is that add the including directory. The preprocessor must know where the file locates in that the preprocessor of the C compiler will copy the header into the source file simply. To add that to the project, click the "Options for Target" button in the toolbar.

Then find the "C/C++" tab and click the "..." button on the right side of the edit box.

And select the `inc` folder in the dialog.

Finally, we must set the C99 standard.

Now you completed this section! Click the "Build" button or press the `F7` key to build your project and check the output has not any errors.
